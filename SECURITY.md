I am not responsible for any misuse of WinDestroyer or any damage caused by it. WinDestroyer is created for educational purposes and to learn how Windows works. If you are thinking of playing a joke on your friend using this program, I recommend that you think about what you are doing first. I'm not entirely sure if there is any way to restore the files.

# How can I avoid this kind of programs?

Simply put, do not download any file from the Internet if you do not know its origin or function. Also, you should scan any suspicious files with online antivirus such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). If you know a bit about advanced computing, you can use websites such as [Any.run](https://any.run/) or [triage](https://tria.ge/).
